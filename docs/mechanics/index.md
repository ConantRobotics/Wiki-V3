# Intro 

Robot combat is a competitive sport where robots designed for combat battle it out in an arena. The mechanical systems used in robot combat typically involve several components that enable the robot to move, attack, and defend itself. Here are some of the key mechanical systems used in robot combat:

- Drive System: The drive system is responsible for the movement of the robot. It typically consists of motors, wheels, and a chassis. The motors provide the power to the wheels, allowing the robot to move forward, backward, and turn.

- Passive Weapon System: The passive weapon system is used to attack the opponent by colliding with it. While the most common form of passive weapon system is a wedge, it's also common to use rams or simply spin in place to mimic a full-body spinner. The passive weapon system must be powered by the wheels, without any active motor control, and the design of the weapon usually makes up the bulk of the robot's chassis.

- Active Weapon System: The active weapon system is used to actively attack the opponent. It can take many forms, including spinning blades, hammers, saws, or hydraulic flippers. The active weapon system is usually powered by a motor or hydraulics system, and the design and placement of the weapon are crucial to the robot's success in combat.

- Armor: Armor is used to protect the robot from damage caused by the opponent's weapon system. It can be made of various materials, such as steel or polycarbonate, and is strategically placed to minimize damage.

In robot combat, the design and implementation of these mechanical systems can significantly impact the robot's performance and success in the arena. Skilled robot builders carefully balance the trade-offs between speed, power, maneuverability, and defense to create a robot that can outmaneuver and outlast its opponents.
