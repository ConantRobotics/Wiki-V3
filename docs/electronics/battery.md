# Battery Info

There are two battery configurations that can be used. 

Option 1 - Single 12V Battery

This option is for robots without any active weapons. The benefit of using this configuration is that the robot can be lighter and easier to maneuver. However, using solely a 12V battery will limit the power of the wheels and shorten how long the battery lasts. 

Option 2 - Two 12V Batteries in Series

This configuration is mandatory if you would like to design a robot with an active weapon. Robots without active weapons can also use this if they want more power and weight. Depending on robot design, this configuration could make a robot more maneuverable while also ensuring some stability. The total 24V could also last much longer while the robot is being used.
