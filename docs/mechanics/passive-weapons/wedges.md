# Wedges

Wedges are the foundation of battlebot design, and for good reason as well. Wedges are lightweight, are easy to understand, easier to drive, and temporarily disable the opponent's robot as they prevent the robot from moving.

As such, the most common weapon system in the Robot Rumble is actually a wedge, as active weapon systems are more complicated to manage and build due to the addition of additional moving parts. Wedges also act as a good "backup" weapon system, as active weapons are more prone to failure as batteries die and belts snap.

Moreover, wedges are extremely valuable when fighting against horizontal spinners, as horizontal spinners only glance off the wedge and take off some of the paint rather than sending the robot into a freespin as they hope to do.

However, wedges add weight, make the robot more vulnerable to failures in the arena, and can be less effective against flippers or vertical spinners as they're more likely to get torn up. This is why some heavyweight battlebots, like Tombstone, go without a wedge, as they want more weight to go to the weapon system rather than the robot.

In this section, we'll go over each of the advantages and disadvantages of wedge weapon systems in depth, and discuss possible variations on wedges to counteract the disadvantages.

## Advantages

### Protection

A wedge is a sloping piece of armor that is typically positioned at the front of a robot. The wedge is designed to deflect the attacks of an opponent's weapon, protecting the robot's wheels, weapons, and other vital components.

One of the primary advantages of using a wedge as a defensive strategy is its simplicity. Unlike other defensive systems, such as shields or active armor, a wedge requires no additional power or complex mechanisms to operate. It is a passive system that is always active and does not rely on the robot's power source to function.

Additionally, wedges can be made from a variety of materials, including steel, polycarbonate, and aluminum. These materials are strong, lightweight, and able to withstand significant punishment. By using these materials, robot builders can create a wedge that is both durable and effective, providing the necessary protection to withstand the most aggressive opponents.

Using a wedge also allows robots to focus their offensive efforts on their opponents, rather than on their own defense. By relying on the wedge to deflect incoming attacks, robots can concentrate on using their own weapons and tactics to defeat their opponents. This strategy can give a robot an edge in the competition, allowing it to deal damage while remaining protected.

### Control

With a low profile and a wedge-shaped front, a robot can push its opponent around the arena or direct them towards hazards, such as spikes or traps. This control can force an opponent to fight on the wedge's terms, increasing the wedge's chances of victory. By dictating the pace of the fight, a robot with a wedge can make it harder for its opponent to use their weapon systems effectively, creating opportunities for counter-attacks and strategic maneuvers.

Wedges are particularly effective against opponents with higher ground clearance. By using a wedge, a robot can lift an opponent off the ground, making it harder for them to use their weapon systems effectively. This is especially true for robots with flippers or hammers, which require a stable base to operate. By disrupting an opponent's balance and lifting them off the ground, a wedge can neutralize their offensive capabilities and leave them vulnerable to counter-attacks.

### Most Effective Against

When used effectively, a wedge can provide a significant advantage over an opponent, regardless of the type of robot being faced.

One of the most vulnerable types of robots against wedges are those with high ground clearance. Robots with high ground clearance typically have wheels or legs that raise the robot off the ground, providing clearance for the wheels or legs to move freely. A wedge can take advantage of this high ground clearance by getting underneath the robot and lifting it off the ground, making it difficult for the robot to move or use its weapons effectively. By lifting the opponent off the ground, the wedge can also leave the opponent susceptible to counter-attacks.

In addition to high ground clearance robots, wedges can also be effective against robots with lifting weapons, such as flippers. These types of robots require a stable base to operate effectively, and a well-placed wedge can destabilize the robot by lifting it off the ground or tipping it over. Once a robot with a lifting weapon is destabilized, it becomes vulnerable to counter-attacks and can be easily disabled.

Another type of robot that is vulnerable to wedges is those with weaker armor. Even if a wedge does not penetrate the armor of a robot, it can still cause damage to the robot's chassis, which can weaken the robot over time. This is particularly effective against robots with a weak chassis that is susceptible to bending or warping.

Wedges can also be used effectively against robots with spinning weapons, such as saws or discs. These weapons require the robot to be stationary or moving in a straight line to be effective. A wedge can disrupt the robot's movement and make it harder for the spinning weapon to connect with the wedge, reducing the effectiveness of the weapon. By constantly moving and maneuvering around the arena, a robot with a wedge can keep a spinning weapon at bay and leave the opponent unable to cause any significant damage.

Additionally, a well-designed wedge can be an effective counter to horizontal spinners. By angling the wedge upwards, the horizontal spinner's weapon will often ride up the wedge and hit the top of the wedge instead of the robot's vulnerable components. The wedge can also be used to redirect the horizontal spinner's attacks and move the opponent into a less advantageous position. A wedge combined with other effective weapons, such as hammers or vertical spinners, can make a robot a formidable opponent for a horizontal spinner.

### Least Effective Against

While wedges can be highly effective in many scenarios, there are certain types of robots that they may be less effective against. Understanding these limitations can be critical to designing a well-rounded robot that can excel in a variety of situations.

One type of robot that wedges may be less effective against are those with highly maneuverable wheels or tracks. These robots can easily move in any direction and often have the ability to strafe or pivot quickly, making it difficult for a wedge to get underneath them. Additionally, robots with maneuverable wheels or tracks may have a lower ground clearance, making it harder for a wedge to lift them off the ground. Against these types of robots, a wedge may need to be combined with other weapons or strategies, such as flipping or grappling, to be effective.

Another type of robot that wedges may be less effective against are those with weapons that can reach over the wedge. For example, robots with vertical spinners or hammers can often attack over the top of a wedge, bypassing the wedge's protective properties. In these situations, a wedge may need to be combined with additional armor or shielding to provide maximum protection against these types of weapons. Alternatively, a robot with a wedge may need to rely on speed and agility to avoid these types of attacks and strike back at vulnerable areas of the opponent.

Robots with a low profile, such as invertible robots, may also be less susceptible to wedges. These robots have a low center of gravity and often have armor that extends down to the ground, making it harder for a wedge to get underneath them. In these scenarios, a wedge may need to be used in conjunction with other weapons or strategies, such as grappling or flipping, to gain an advantage over the opponent.

Lastly, robots with high-powered lifting weapons, such as flippers, may also be less vulnerable to wedges. These robots can often lift themselves up to avoid wedges and may be able to flip or grapple a wedge-equipped robot to gain the upper hand. Against these types of robots, a wedge may need to be combined with other weapons or strategies, such as a flamethrower or hammer, to be effective.
