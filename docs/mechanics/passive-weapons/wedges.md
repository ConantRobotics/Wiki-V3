# Wedges

Wedges are the foundation of battlebot design, and for good reason as well. Wedges are lightweight, are easy to understand, easier to drive, and temporarily disable the opponent's robot as they prevent the robot from moving.

As such, the most common weapon system in the Robot Rumble is actually a wedge, as active weapon systems are more complicated to manage and build due to the addition of additional moving parts. Wedges also act as a good "backup" weapon system, as active weapons are more prone to failure as batteries die and belts snap.

Moreover, wedges are extremely valuable when fighting against horizontal spinners, as horizontal spinners only glance off the wedge and take off some of the paint rather than sending the robot into a freespin as they hope to do.

However, wedges add weight, make the robot more vulnerable to failures in the arena, and can be less effective against flippers or vertical spinners as they're more likely to get torn up. This is why some heavyweight battlebots, like Tombstone, go without a wedge, as they want more weight to go to the weapon system rather than the robot.

In this section, we'll go over each of the advantages and disadvantages of wedge weapon systems in depth, and discuss possible variations on wedges to counteract the disadvantages.

## Advantages

### Protection

A wedge is a sloping piece of armor that is typically positioned at the front of a robot. The wedge is designed to deflect the attacks of an opponent's weapon, protecting the robot's wheels, weapons, and other vital components.

One of the primary advantages of using a wedge as a defensive strategy is its simplicity. Unlike other defensive systems, such as shields or active armor, a wedge requires no additional power or complex mechanisms to operate. It is a passive system that is always active and does not rely on the robot's power source to function.

Additionally, wedges can be made from a variety of materials, including steel, polycarbonate, and aluminum. These materials are strong, lightweight, and able to withstand significant punishment. By using these materials, robot builders can create a wedge that is both durable and effective, providing the necessary protection to withstand the most aggressive opponents.

Using a wedge also allows robots to focus their offensive efforts on their opponents, rather than on their own defense. By relying on the wedge to deflect incoming attacks, robots can concentrate on using their own weapons and tactics to defeat their opponents. This strategy can give a robot an edge in the competition, allowing it to deal damage while remaining protected.
