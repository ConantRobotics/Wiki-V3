# About

## Who We Are

Conant Robotics is a high school combat robotics team located in James B. Conant High School in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, participating in the lightweight and middleweight combat categories at the D214 Robot Rumble.

This wiki was founded by the 2023 Conant Robotics team members after Conant High School's undefeated first place finish.

### Sign up for a Github Account

1. Navigate to [www.github.com](https://github.com/).
![github home page](img/signup/signup1.png)

2. Click the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner and go through the signup process to create your GitHub account.

### Adding text to the Wiki

3. Navigate to [the Conant Robotics Repository](https://github.com/ConantRobotics/Wiki-V3). This is the repository that the documentation is based off of.
![robotics repo](img/signup/signup3.png)

4. Click on the folder named "docs", then "about.md" until you see a screen like the one below:
![index file](img/signup/signup4.png)

5. Click the pencil icon next to "Raw" and "Blame" so you can edit the file. Add your name to the bottom of the file under "Contributors". IMAGE IS TODO

6. Now it's time to make some formatting changes to your name. Add two asterisks to the left and right of your name so that it looks like \*\*your name\*\*. If you click on the Preview tab at the top of the page, you can see that your name has been **bolded**. IMAGE IS TODO

7. You can also _italicize_  your name by adding underscores (\_) to the left and right of your name. Remove the asterisks next to your name and replace them with underscores so it looks like \_your name\_. If you click on the Preview tab again, your name should be italicized. IMAGE IS TODO

8. These modifiers can also be stacked, enabling you to really emphasize _**your name**_. Add the two asterisks back in, this time adding them around the underscores so it looks like \*\*\_your name\_\*\*. Now, your name should be **bolded** and _italicized_ in the Preview tab. IMAGE IS TODO

9. After modifying the Contributors section to contain **_your name_**, press the green "Create a pull request" button at the bottom of the page. This will open a request for the Wiki moderator (Mr. Bruce or Mr. LeBlanc) to accept your changes and enter them into the wiki. IMAGE IS TODO

### Adding an image to the Wiki

10. Then, go back to the top of the page, and click the "docs" under "Wiki-V3/docs/about.md" file structure. This will take you back to the home directory, enabling you to enter the "img" directory containing all of the images. Once you're inside the "img" directory, press "Add Files" -> "Upload Files" and upload any image you have of yourself. This will be the image that goes under your name in the "Contributors section". IMAGE IS TODO

11. Finally, go back to "docs/about.md" and add a link to your image under your name by adding **\!\[your name here\]\(/img/yourimagename.png\)**. IMAGE IS TODO

12. Create a pull request for your image by click the green "Create a pull request" button. Once your pull request has been accepted, you'll have successfully added your name and image to the Contributors section and are officially ready to begin contributing to the wiki!

## Using a Proper Editor
Alternatively, you can write documentation on the school computers! This is much easier while still giving you advanced editing control over the directories.

It's also just a nicer editor based off of VSCode, so I would recommend having some VSCode or at least IDE experience in order to use this method.

To enter the online VSCode editor, navigate to this repo's GitHub page ([here](https://github.com/ConantRobotics/Wiki-V3)) and press the period button on your keyboard (".").
If this doesn't work, click on this link: [https://github.dev/ConantRobotics/Wiki-V3](https://github.dev/ConantRobotics/Wiki-V3)

This will take you into an online IDE that looks like this:
![image of web editor](img/signup/EditorImage.PNG)

You can navigate within the file directory on the left to find the file that you want, and even upload images into the **docs/img** directory.

This will be second nature to all of you who are in computer science, so I advice you use this method rather than all the novice stuff I wrote up earlier.

## Advanced Contributions

If you're looking at this section, it's assumed that you already:  
- Have a GitHub account with your own coding projects in it  
- Know how to contribute to a GitHub repository without going through the web interface  
- Know how to clone, commit, and pull from a repo.  
- Have promised not to do anything stupid with GitHub that would crash the Wiki.  
- Know how to not do anything stupid with GitHub that would crash the Wiki.
- ~~Know how to quit Vim~~

If you want and know how to, you can clone this repo onto your personal computer and use it to develop on the Wiki. 

I recommend this solution if you're working with images, as it makes it easy to add all of the images into the img folder under a subdirectory. It's also helpful if you are very comfortable in your own IDE (all hail Vim) as it makes typing articles up much easier.

There's no tutorial for this because I'm lazy, but it's good to try it out, especially if you're authoring a completely new article.

## Motivation

This wiki was founded by Anmay Gupta and the rest of the Robotics Club Class of '23 after realizing that none of the underclassmen knew anything about mechanical design and all of the seniors were graduating the next year.

Additionally, the first two months of meetings were often spent reconstructing the work of the past year, leading to consistent "what were the receiver bindings again?" and "how do I bind the receiver" and "why isn't our receiver turning on" and "green goes down, right?" and a whole lot of other questions that aren't related to the receiver I promise.

Moreover, these questions would lead to rediscovery of already known information, such as how power management works for the batteries or how the receiver can be switched from plane mode into tank mode.

That's why this wiki was created: to act as a digital repository of all discovered information because we ~~hate answering obvious questions~~ want to keep the team running efficiently and effectively after we graduate.
