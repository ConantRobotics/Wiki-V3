There are various types of drive systems that can be used for robot combat, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of the most common types of drive systems used in robot combat and how they work:</p> <ul> <li>Differential Drive: Differential drive is the most common type of drive system used in robot combat. It uses two independently controlled wheels or tracks on each side of the robot, with each wheel or track powered by a separate motor. By varying the speed and direction of each motor, the robot can turn, move forward or backward, and spin in place. Differential drive provides good maneuverability and control, but can be vulnerable to tipping over if the weight distribution is not well-balanced.</li> </ul> <p>Janktality used a differential drive system due to its simplicity and manueverability, enabling it to run circles around its opponents in the final competition.</p> <ul> <li>Differential Drive with Casters: This is the same basic concept as a differential drive, but it utilizes two additional wheels in the front of the robot to reduce scraping on the arena floor. By using these additional wheels, the robot is able to better traverse uneven terrain (such as a torn-up arena floor) and often has improved control. However, it's extremely difficult to create a wedge using this drive system, as a wedge needs to scrape the floor in order to be effective. As such, this method is often used on very long or wide robots that \"sag\" in the center, using the two caster wheels to lift the center back up.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Spatula, a hydraulic flipper, used two ball casters under its wedge to prevent the wedge from scraping the ground and reducing manueverability. There's only one in the picture as we knocked off the other one.</p> <ul> <li>Tank Treads: Tank treads are a type of drive system that use continuous tracks on each side of the robot, similar to those used on tanks. They provide good traction and stability, making them ideal for robots that need to traverse rough terrain or obstacles. However, they are typically slower and less maneuverable than other types of drive systems, resulting in them being rarely used in the Robot Rumble.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Omni-Directional Drive: Omni-directional drive systems use three or more wheels or rollers arranged in a specific pattern to provide the robot with the ability to move in any direction, rotate around its own axis, and move sideways. These systems provide excellent maneuverability and speed, but can be more complex and expensive to build. They are rarely used in the Robot Rumble due to their high weight and lack of power delivery when ramming other robots.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Four-Wheel Drive: Four-wheel drive systems use four independently controlled wheels to provide the robot with greater stability and traction than a two-wheel drive system. By controlling the speed and direction of each wheel, the robot can turn, move forward or backward, and spin in place. Four-wheel drive systems are typically more stable and maneuverable than two-wheel drive systems, but due to their weight are not used within the Robot Rumble.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Hybrid Drive: Hybrid drive systems combine two or more types of drive systems, such as differential drive and tank treads or omni-directional drive and four-wheel drive. These systems offer the benefits of each type of drive system, but can be more complex and difficult to control. The most common usage of these drives is in the creation of custom geartrains, as some robots will use tracks as a method of gear reduction.</li> </ul> <p>In addition to the type of drive system used, the motors and controllers used to power and control the robot's movement are also important. High-quality, durable motors and controllers are essential for providing the robot with the power and precision it needs to navigate the battlefield and outmaneuver its opponents. The drive system and motors should be designed to work in harmony with the robot's other systems, such as its weapon and control systems, to provide an effective and efficient combat robot.</p> <p>This article authored by Anmay Gupta and ChatGPT in March 2023.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/drive/diffdrive/","title":"Differential Drives","text":"<p>Due to it's frequent usage within battlebot competitions, it's important to address the limitations and the functionality of a differential drive in greater detail.</p> <p>A differential drive is a type of drive system commonly used in robots for its simplicity and maneuverability. This system consists of two independently controlled wheels or tracks, one on each side of the robot. Each wheel is powered by its own motor, which allows the robot to move forward and backward and turn in place by varying the speed and direction of each motor.</p> <p>The differential drive system works by using the difference in speed between the two wheels to turn the robot. For example, if the robot wants to turn to the left, the motor on the right side of the robot will slow down while the motor on the left side will speed up. This causes the robot to turn to the left as the wheels on the left side move faster than the wheels on the right side.</p> <p>The differential drive system is easy to implement and provides good control and maneuverability in a variety of environments. It is also relatively efficient and has a low power consumption compared to other drive systems.</p> <p>However, the differential drive system has some limitations. One major issue is that it can be prone to tipping over if the weight distribution of the robot is not well-balanced. This is because the robot relies on its wheels for stability, and if the weight is not distributed evenly, the robot may tip over when turning or accelerating.</p> <p>Additionally, a robot with too much weight on one side will have greater traction on that side. This results in the heavy side speeding up much faster than the other side, making the robot much harder to manuever as the robot will overshoot or undershoot turns unpredictably.</p> <p>This is the ideal center of mass distribution for a differential drive, as it ensures both wheels have the same traction. That's why supremely tight and fast turns could be taken during battle, opening up multiple methods to counterattack after being rammed into the wall.</p> <p>This distribution is what was operated the first year of Janktality's operation,</p> <p>Another limitation of differential drive systems is that they can struggle on uneven or rough terrain. This is because the wheels may lose traction or become stuck on obstacles, making it difficult for the robot to move or turn. This is often resolved by placing casters on the bottom of the robot that can roll over any terrain differences, but it can be compensated for with a skilled driver.</p> <p></p> <p>In 2020, Schaumburg's driver was bad (way worse than I am), so they drove over a crack in the arena floor that lifted their robot up slightly, as you can see in the image. This, combined with the gradual dulling of their wedge during the competition, allowed the flipper they were facing to slip their wedge under the robot and easily flip them. If you want to see the full fight, watch the 2020 Robot Rumble video at timestamp 5:37:50.</p> <p>Overall, the differential drive system is a versatile and efficient drive system that is well-suited for many types of robot combat. However, designers must be aware of its limitations and work to ensure the robot's weight distribution and wheel design are optimized for maximum stability and control.</p> <p>This article authored by Anmay Gupta and ChatGPT in March 2023.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/hammers/","title":"Hammers","text":"<ul> <li>Article Title</li> </ul>"},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/hammers/#article-title","title":"Article Title","text":"<p>This article authored by Your Name in Month 202x.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/melty/","title":"Melty-Brains","text":"<ul> <li>Article Title</li> </ul>"},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/melty/#article-title","title":"Article Title","text":"<p>This article authored by Your Name in Month 202x.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/rams/","title":"Rams","text":"<ul> <li>Article Title</li> </ul>"},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/rams/#article-title","title":"Article Title","text":"<p>This article authored by Your Name in Month 202x.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/wedges/","title":"Wedges","text":"<ul> <li>Wedges<ul> <li>Advantages<ul> <li>Protection</li> <li>Control</li> <li>Most Effective Against</li> <li>Least Effective Against</li> </ul> </li> <li>Wedgelets</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/wedges/#wedges","title":"Wedges","text":"<p>Wedges are the foundation of battlebot design, and for good reason as well. Wedges are lightweight, are easy to understand, easier to drive, and temporarily disable the opponent's robot as they prevent the robot from moving.</p> <p>As such, the most common weapon system in the Robot Rumble is actually a wedge, as active weapon systems are more complicated to manage and build due to the addition of additional moving parts. Wedges also act as a good \"backup\" weapon system, as active weapons are more prone to failure as batteries die and belts snap.</p> <p>Moreover, wedges are extremely valuable when fighting against horizontal spinners, as horizontal spinners only glance off the wedge and take off some of the paint rather than sending the robot into a freespin as they hope to do.</p> <p>However, wedges add weight, make the robot more vulnerable to failures in the arena, and can be less effective against flippers or vertical spinners as they're more likely to get torn up. This is why some heavyweight battlebots, like Tombstone, go without a wedge, as they want more weight to go to the weapon system rather than the robot.</p> <p>In this section, we'll go over each of the advantages and disadvantages of wedge weapon systems in depth, and discuss possible variations on wedges to counteract the disadvantages.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/wedges/#advantages","title":"Advantages","text":""},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/wedges/#protection","title":"Protection","text":"<p>A wedge is a sloping piece of armor that is typically positioned at the front of a robot. The wedge is designed to deflect the attacks of an opponent's weapon, protecting the robot's wheels, weapons, and other vital components.</p> <p>One of the primary advantages of using a wedge as a defensive strategy is its simplicity. Unlike other defensive systems, such as shields or active armor, a wedge requires no additional power or complex mechanisms to operate. It is a passive system that is always active and does not rely on the robot's power source to function.</p> <p>Additionally, wedges can be made from a variety of materials, including steel, polycarbonate, and aluminum. These materials are strong, lightweight, and able to withstand significant punishment. By using these materials, robot builders can create a wedge that is both durable and effective, providing the necessary protection to withstand the most aggressive opponents.</p> <p>Using a wedge also allows robots to focus their offensive efforts on their opponents, rather than on their own defense. By relying on the wedge to deflect incoming attacks, robots can concentrate on using their own weapons and tactics to defeat their opponents. This strategy can give a robot an edge in the competition, allowing it to deal damage while remaining protected.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/wedges/#control","title":"Control","text":"<p>With a low profile and a wedge-shaped front, a robot can push its opponent around the arena or direct them towards hazards, such as spikes or traps. This control can force an opponent to fight on the wedge's terms, increasing the wedge's chances of victory. By dictating the pace of the fight, a robot with a wedge can make it harder for its opponent to use their weapon systems effectively, creating opportunities for counter-attacks and strategic maneuvers.</p> <p>Wedges are particularly effective against opponents with higher ground clearance. By using a wedge, a robot can lift an opponent off the ground, making it harder for them to use their weapon systems effectively. This is especially true for robots with flippers or hammers, which require a stable base to operate. By disrupting an opponent's balance and lifting them off the ground, a wedge can neutralize their offensive capabilities and leave them vulnerable to counter-attacks.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/wedges/#most-effective-against","title":"Most Effective Against","text":"<p>When used effectively, a wedge can provide a significant advantage over an opponent, regardless of the type of robot being faced.</p> <p>One of the most vulnerable types of robots against wedges are those with high ground clearance. Robots with high ground clearance typically have wheels or legs that raise the robot off the ground, providing clearance for the wheels or legs to move freely. A wedge can take advantage of this high ground clearance by getting underneath the robot and lifting it off the ground, making it difficult for the robot to move or use its weapons effectively. By lifting the opponent off the ground, the wedge can also leave the opponent susceptible to counter-attacks.</p> <p>In addition to high ground clearance robots, wedges can also be effective against robots with lifting weapons, such as flippers. These types of robots require a stable base to operate effectively, and a well-placed wedge can destabilize the robot by lifting it off the ground or tipping it over. Once a robot with a lifting weapon is destabilized, it becomes vulnerable to counter-attacks and can be easily disabled.</p> <p>Another type of robot that is vulnerable to wedges is those with weaker armor. Even if a wedge does not penetrate the armor of a robot, it can still cause damage to the robot's chassis, which can weaken the robot over time. This is particularly effective against robots with a weak chassis that is susceptible to bending or warping.</p> <p>Wedges can also be used effectively against robots with spinning weapons, such as saws or discs. These weapons require the robot to be stationary or moving in a straight line to be effective. A wedge can disrupt the robot's movement and make it harder for the spinning weapon to connect with the wedge, reducing the effectiveness of the weapon. By constantly moving and maneuvering around the arena, a robot with a wedge can keep a spinning weapon at bay and leave the opponent unable to cause any significant damage.</p> <p>Additionally, a well-designed wedge can be an effective counter to horizontal spinners. By angling the wedge upwards, the horizontal spinner's weapon will often ride up the wedge and hit the top of the wedge instead of the robot's vulnerable components. The wedge can also be used to redirect the horizontal spinner's attacks and move the opponent into a less advantageous position. A wedge combined with other effective weapons, such as hammers or vertical spinners, can make a robot a formidable opponent for a horizontal spinner.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/passive-weapons/wedges/#least-effective-against","title":"Least Effective Against","text":"<p>While wedges can be highly effective in many scenarios, there are certain types of robots that they may be less effective against. Understanding these limitations can be critical to designing a well-rounded robot that can excel in a variety of situations.</p> <p>One type of robot that wedges may be less effective against are those with highly maneuverable wheels or tracks. These robots can easily move in any direction and often have the ability to strafe or pivot quickly, making it difficult for a wedge to get underneath them. Additionally, robots with maneuverable wheels or tracks may have a lower ground clearance, making it harder for a wedge to lift them off the ground. Against these types of robots, a wedge may need to be combined with other weapons or strategies, such as flipping or grappling, to be effective.</p> <p>This is why robot drive systems are so important! </p> <p>Another type of robot that wedges may be less effective against are those with weapons that can reach over the wedge. For example, robots with vertical spinners or hammers can often attack over the top of a wedge, bypassing the wedge's protective properties. In these situations, a wedge may need to be combined with additional armor or shielding to provide maximum protection against these types of weapons. Alternatively, a robot with a wedge may need to rely on speed and agility to avoid these types of attacks and strike back at vulnerable areas of the opponent.</p> <p>Robots with a low profile, such as invertible robots, may also be less susceptible to wedges. These robots have a low center of gravity and often have armor that extends down to the ground, making it harder for a wedge to get underneath them. In these scenarios, a wedge may need to be used in conjunction with other weapons or strategies, such as grappling or flipping, to gain an advantage over the opponent.</p> <p>Lastly, robots with high-powered lifting weapons, such as flippers, may also be less vulnerable to wedges. These robots can often lift themselves up to avoid wedges and may be able to flip or grapple a wedge-equipped robot to gain the upper hand.

Weapon systems in battlebots can be divided into two broad categories: passive and active.</p> <p>Passive weapon systems are designed to absorb or deflect the impact of an opponent's weapon. These can include armor plates, wedges, and shields. Armor plates are typically made of hardened steel or other materials that can resist damage from spinning weapons, hammers, and other active weapons. Wedges are designed to deflect an opponent's attack, and shields can be used to protect vulnerable components of the robot.</p> <p>Active weapon systems, on the other hand, are designed to damage or disable an opponent's robot. These can include spinning weapons, flippers, hammers, saws, and crushers. Spinning weapons are often the most destructive and generate a significant amount of kinetic energy.
