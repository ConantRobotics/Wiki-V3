# Intro to Robot Combat - Electronics

- Control System: The control system allows the operator to control the robot's movements and weapons. It typically includes a radio transmitter, a receiver, and a speed controller that interprets the operator's commands and controls the robot's actions.

- Battery System: The battery system provides power to the robot's electrical components, such as the motors, control system, and weapon system. The battery system must be carefully designed to provide enough power for the robot to operate for the entire match.

In robot combat, the design and implementation of these electrical systems can revolutionize the robot's utility in the arena. Skilled robot builders ensure the strength of every connection to the receiver and carefully balance the speed of the robot between power and battery life to create a robot that can outmaneuver and outlast its opponents.
