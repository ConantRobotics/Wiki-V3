# Motivation

This wiki was founded by Anmay Gupta and the rest of the Robotics Club Class of '23 after realizing that none of the underclassmen knew anything about mechanical design and all of the seniors were graduating the next year.

Additionally, the first two months of meetings were often spent reconstructing the work of the past year, leading to consistent "what were the receiver bindings again?" and "how do I bind the receiver" and "why isn't our receiver turning on" and "green goes down, right?" and a whole lot of other questions that aren't related to the receiver I promise.

Moreover, these questions would lead to rediscovery of already known information, such as how power management works for the batteries or how the receiver can be switched from plane mode into tank mode.

That's why this wiki was created: to act as a digital repository of all discovered information because we ~~hate answering obvious questions~~ want to keep the team running efficiently and effectively after we graduate.
